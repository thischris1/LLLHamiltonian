# LLLHamiltonian
A c++  project which allows you to calculate spectra, eigenstates, densities, electron-electron correlations, electron-vortex and vortex-vortex correlations for a FQH hamiltonian (LLL only)


For building you need:
-qmake
- Eigen library
- the MKL library
- gsl library 

Change the path in the .pro file to the proper directories, run qmake and make.
